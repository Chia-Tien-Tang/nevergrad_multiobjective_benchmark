Steps of Running Our Project:

1. Clone the nevergrad to local Github (Normally, clone it to your Desktop)

2. Download 4 files (in “Coding Files” folder) on our GoogleDrive 

3. Add these 4 files(__init__.py, core.py, functions.py and test.py) into this folder: “nevergrad/nevergrad/functions/multiobjective”

4. Add example.py into your Desktop

5. Run this in terminal
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:”YourPathWhereYouStore/nevergrad”

6. Run this to see our constrain are all correct
python YourPathWhereYouStore/nevergrad/nevergrad/functions/multiobjective/test.py

7. Run this command to see if code of functions.py is normal or not
python Desktop/example.py
